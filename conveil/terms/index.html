        <p><strong>Conveil.com Terms of Use Agreement</strong></p>

        <p><strong>April 23, 2021</strong></p>

        <p>Conveil, Inc. (“Conveil” or “we”) operates Conveil.com, which is a social networking platform that allows Members to create unique personal profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new friends. The services offered by Conveil include any Conveil-branded URL (the "Conveil Website"), Conveil messaging services (including, without limitation, instant messaging, private messaging, and email services), Conveil music and video services, Conveil developer services, Conveil mobile services, and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Conveil in connection with Conveil’s business (collectively, the "Conveil Services"). The Conveil Services are hosted in the United States.</p>

        <p>This Terms of Use Agreement, as may be modified from time to time, ("Agreement") constitutes legally binding terms and applies to your use of the Conveil Services. By accessing and/or using the Conveil Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the Conveil Services, including, without limitation, through a mobile or other wireless device, or otherwise use the Conveil Services without being registered) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with Conveil). The term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. You are authorized to use the Conveil Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) only if you agree to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations (“Applicable Law”) and the terms of this Agreement. In addition, in consideration for becoming a Member and/or making use of the Conveil Services, you must indicate your acceptance of this Agreement during the registration process.</p>

        <p>Conveil reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time and from time to time, and each such modification shall be effective upon posting on the Conveil Services. All material modifications will apply prospectively only. Your continued use of the Conveil Services following any such modification constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the Agreement as so modified. It is therefore important that you review this Agreement regularly. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement and to abide by all Applicable Law, you must discontinue use of the Conveil Services immediately. You may receive a copy of this Agreement by emailing us at: privacy@Conveil.com, Subject: Terms of Use Agreement.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Eligibility.</strong> Use of the Conveil Services and registration to be a Member for the Conveil Services (“Membership”) is void where prohibited. By using the Conveil Services, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your use of the Conveil Services does not violate any Applicable Law. Your profile may be deleted and your Membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under 13 years of age, if we believe that you are under 18 years of age and you represent yourself as 18 or older, or if we believe you are over 18 and represent yourself as under 18.</li>

          <li><strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement, and any posted revision to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Conveil Services or are a Member. You may terminate your Membership at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions on the Member's Account Settings page. Conveil may terminate your Membership at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability. Furthermore, Conveil reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including, without limitation, private messages, emails and instant messages (collectively, “messages”)) by you, or to deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Conveil Services at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice or explanation, and without liability. In addition, Conveil reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reassign or rename your profile URL. Conveil expressly reserves the right to remove your profile and/or deny, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Conveil Services if Conveil determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement or pose a threat to Conveil, its employees, business partners, Users and/or the public. Even after Membership is terminated, this Agreement will remain in effect, including, without limitation, Sections 5-18.</li>

          <li><strong>Fees.</strong> You acknowledge that Conveil reserves the right to charge for any portion of the Conveil Services and to change its fees (if any) from time to time in its discretion. If Conveil terminates your Membership because you have breached the Agreement, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of fees or payments (if any).</li>

          <li><strong>Password.</strong> When you sign up to become a Member, you will also be asked to choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You agree not to use the account, username, email address or password of another Member at any time or to disclose your password to any third party.

          <li><strong>Use by Members.</strong> The Conveil Services are for the personal use of Members and may only be used for direct commercial purposes if they are specifically endorsed or authorized by Conveil. Conveil reserves the right to remove commercial content in its sole discretion. Illegal and/or unauthorized use of the Conveil Services, including, without limitation, collecting usernames, user id numbers, and/or email addresses of Members by electronic or other means for the purpose of sending unsolicited email or unauthorized framing of or linking to the Conveil Services, or employing third party promotional sites or software to promote profiles for money, is prohibited. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of unauthorized data collection or solicitation may be removed from Member profiles without notice or explanation and may result in termination of Membership privileges.

          <li>
            <span><strong>Proprietary Rights in Content on Conveil.</strong></span>
            <ol>
              <li>Conveil does not claim any ownership rights in the text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, applications, or any other materials (collectively, "Content") that you transmit, submit, display or publish (“post”) on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services. After posting your Content on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your Content, subject to the limited license herein. By posting any Content on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services, you hereby grant to Conveil a limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content solely on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services, including, without limitation, through the Conveil Services to applications, widgets, websites or mobile, desktop or other services which are linked with your Conveil account (collectively, “Linked Services”), including, without limitation, distributing part or all of the Conveil Services and any Content included therein, in any media formats and through any media channels, except that Content marked “private” will not be distributed by Conveil outside the Conveil Services and Linked Services. This limited license does not grant Conveil the right to sell or otherwise distribute your Content outside of the Conveil Services or Linked Services. After you remove your Content from the Conveil Services we will cease distribution as soon as practicable, and at such time when distribution ceases, the license will terminate. If after we have distributed your Content outside of the Conveil Services, you change the Content’s privacy setting to “private,” we will cease distribution of such “private” Content outside of the Conveil Services as soon as practicable after you make the change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that once Content is distributed to a Linked Service or incorporated into other aspects of the Conveil Services, Conveil is under no obligation to delete or ask other Users or a Linked Service to delete that Content, and therefore it may continue to appear and be used indefinitely.</li>

              <li>The license you grant to Conveil is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Conveil), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Conveil is not required to pay you or anyone else deriving rights from you for the use on the Conveil Services of the Content that you post), sublicensable (so that Conveil is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the Conveil Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Conveil Services are global in reach).</li>

              <li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services, or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this Section 6, and (ii) the posting of your Content on, through or in connection with the Conveil Services and/or Linked Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person or entity by reason of the use of any Content posted by you on or through the Conveil Services and/or Linked Services.</li>

              <li>The Conveil Services contain Content of Conveil ("Conveil Content"). Conveil Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and Conveil owns and retains all rights in the Conveil Content and the Conveil Services. Conveil hereby grants you a limited, revocable, nonsublicensable license to reproduce and display the Conveil Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with viewing the Conveil Website and using the Conveil Services.</li>

              <li>The Conveil Services contain Content of Users and other Conveil licensors. Except as provided within this Agreement, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, sell or otherwise use any Content appearing on or through the Conveil Services.</li>

              <li>Conveil performs technical functions necessary to offer the Conveil Services, including, but not limited to, the technical processing and transmission of email communications to perform the email service, and transcoding and/or reformatting Content to allow its use throughout the Conveil Services. In addition, you agree and acknowledge that Conveil may send messages including, but not limited to, notifications, special offers, promotions, commercial advertisements, and marketing materials, in connection with the Conveil Services. You can control what type of communications you receive from the Conveil Services by logging into your account and choosing the appropriate notifications settings or by following the unsubscribe instructions contained at the bottom of commercial emails.</li>

Despite this prohibition, information, materials, products or services provided by other Conveil Members (for instance, in their profiles) or Linked Services may, in whole or in part, be unauthorized, impermissible or otherwise violate this Agreement, and Conveil assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the Conveil Services by any person or Linked Service, please click on the "Contact Conveil” or the “Report Abuse” link at the bottom of the Conveil Website pages.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Conveil may reject, refuse to post or delete any Content for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, Content that in the sole judgment of Conveil violates this Agreement or which may be offensive, illegal or violate the rights of any person or entity, or harm or threaten the safety of any person or entity. Conveil assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Conveil Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If at any time Conveil chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the Conveil Services, Conveil nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content.</li>
